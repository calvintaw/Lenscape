# Lenscape (Legacy Version)

An early image and video discovery web application inspired by platforms like Pexels and Pixabay. This project was my first attempt at building a multi-page React app with API integration and media previews.

## 🔋 Features

- **Photo & Video Pages**: Separate pages for browsing photos and videos.
- **Basic Media Preview**: Click on an item to see a larger preview with minimal details.
- **Search**: Search for images and videos using the Pexels API.
- **Direct Downloads**: Download media directly from the preview page.

> ⚠️ Note: Some features were experimental and not fully implemented, as this project was built before a six-month break from development. Upon returning, I rebuilt Lenscape with a fresh approach to reinforce learning.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React**: Component-based UI development.
- **React Router**: Client-side routing for pages.
- **Vite**: Development and build tool.
- **Pixabay API**: Source of images and videos.

## 🎯 Purpose & Learnings

This project was a stepping stone to practice:

- Managing state for search and media previews.
- Using React Router for dynamic routing.
- Fetching data from an external API and rendering it dynamically.

## Areas for Improvement

- Better code structure

- UI design

- Color palettes

- Intuitive searching for photos and videos: right now, selecting an option like “Illustration” in the slider bar only searches that query. It doesn’t act as a type filter, so if you click “Illustration” and then search “dogs,” you’ll get random types of dog images. Need to be made easier to understand and use.

It served as a foundation for my **rebuilt Lenscape**, which has fewer features but more structured and maintainable code.
