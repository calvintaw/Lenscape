# Lenscape (Legacy Version)

An early image and video discovery web application inspired by platforms like Pexels and Pixabay. This project was my first attempt at building a multi-page React app with API integration and media previews.

## üîã Features

- **Photo & Video Pages**: Separate pages for browsing photos and videos.
- **Basic Media Preview**: Click on an item to see a larger preview with minimal details.
- **Search**: Search for images and videos using the Pexels API.
- **Direct Downloads**: Download media directly from the preview page.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Some features were experimental and not fully implemented, as this project was built before a six-month break from development. Upon returning, I rebuilt Lenscape with a fresh approach to reinforce learning.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **React**: Component-based UI development.
- **React Router**: Client-side routing for pages.
- **Vite**: Development and build tool.
- **Pixabay API**: Source of images and videos.

## üéØ Purpose & Learnings

This project was a stepping stone to practice:

- Managing state for search and media previews.
- Using React Router for dynamic routing.
- Fetching data from an external API and rendering it dynamically.

It served as a foundation for my **rebuilt Lenscape**, which has fewer features but more structured and maintainable code.
